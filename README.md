# Hangman (Console Version)

A simple beginner-friendly Hangman game implemented in Python.  
Runs fully in the console, no external libraries needed.

## Features
- Hidden secret word entry (Player 1 cannot be seen)
- Validates secret word: must contain only letters a–z
- Validates guesses: single letter, not previously guessed
- Clean console display with attempts left
- Play-again loop (automatically restarts game)
- Sorted list of guessed letters for readability
- Procedural programming style (no classes)

## How to Run



## How to Play
1. Player 1 enters a secret word (input is hidden).
2. Player 2 guesses one letter at a time.
3. The game reveals correct letters and counts wrong guesses.
4. You win by guessing all letters before running out of attempts.
5. After each round, choose whether to play again.

## Future Improvements
- Add ASCII-art hangman visuals
- Allow passing secret word via command-line
- Add random word mode
- Track wins/losses

## Requirements
- Python 3.11 or 3.13 (recommended)

Happy coding! 🎉
